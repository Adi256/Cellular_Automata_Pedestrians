# Cellular_Automata_Pedestrians
Thesis project that implements a cellular automata to simulate the evacuation of pedestrians in an emergency situation. The trampling phenomena will be implemented. The aim is to observe which pedestrian behavior or variable leads to trampling.

Aknowledgements and credits to Dr. Lakoari Nouredinne, PhD and Dr. Julio César Pérez Sansalvador, PhD for their assesment and constant help in the work of this thesis.
